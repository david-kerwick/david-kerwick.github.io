I have a Red Hat test server I needed to set up with a fixed IP address. Â Handy info with a good bit of info available so just a memory dump for handy reference.  
Go to  

``` bash
cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts  
```

It will probably be the first network card on the system if not adjust the eth number as appropriate  

``` bash
vi ifcfg-eth0  
```

Edit the file adding entries like this  

``` bash
DEVICE=eth0  
BOOTPROTO=static  
IPADDR=192.168.1.10  
ONBOOT=yes  
DNS1=192.168.1.2  
DNS2=192.168.1.3  
DNS3=192.168.1.4  
DOMAIN=yourdomain.ie  
SEARCH=yourdomain.ie  
GATEWAY=192.168.1.1  
```

For some reason the gateway settings wouldn't work when entered into /etc/sysconfig/network but adding it to the network script did.  

You need to restart the networking service for the changes to take effect.  

``` bash
/etc/init.d/networking restart  
```

You should now have a fixed IP, you can check the other setting worked by  

``` bash
cat /etc/resolv.conf   

# Generated by NetworkManager  
search gms.ie  
nameserver 192.168.215.10  
nameserver 192.168.215.46  
nameserver 192.168.215.6  

route -n

```
