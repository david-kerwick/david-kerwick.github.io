So you have been starting the admin server using the startWeblogic.sh script and you are tired of entering the username and password each time. Â You want the credentials stored, this can be done by creating a boot.properties file where the admin server will take the credentials.  

Go to your domain directory and cd into the servers/Adminserver directory  

for example  

``` bash 
cd /user_projects/domains/your_domain/servers/Adminserver/  
```

If there isn't a security directory create it  

``` bash
mkdir security  
```

then cd into it  

``` bash
cd security  
```

now create the boot.properties file  

``` bash
vi boot.properties  
```

add in lines for your username and password  

``` bash 
username=weblogic  
password=weblogic1  
```

You should now be able to run startWeblogic.sh without it prompting you for a username and password.  
After starting if you look back at the boot.properties file you will notice that weblogic has encrypted the contents for you.
