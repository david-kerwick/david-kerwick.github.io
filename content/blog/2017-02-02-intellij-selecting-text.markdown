To select text in IntelliJ using the keyboard in intelligent blocks can be pretty handy.  It starts moving the selection up to the next 'level' which means you can quickly select a line, if statement, method, etc...

The key combo is

- OPTION UP-ARROW (expand it)
- OPTION DOWN-ARROW (shrink it)

So I was going to try keep it to one shortcut per post as a kind of easy find type thing but moving text you've selected is too damn close not to mention it side by side.

- OPTION SHIFT UP-ARROW (move selection up)
- OPTION SHIFT DOWN-ARROW (move selection down)
