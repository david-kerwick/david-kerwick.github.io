Starting the IntelliJ shortcut remembering series with the one I use alot.  Switching to recent files.

So rather than finding the file in the structure view most of the time you will be swapping between files you have recently opened or edited.

So the two combos are

- CMD E (recent files)
- CMD SHIFT E (recently edited)
