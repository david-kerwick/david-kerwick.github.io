You totally should.</p>\n<p>Anyway first add the mvn plugin to your plugin list in <code class=\"language-text\">.zshrc</code>\ne.g</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">plugins=(git mvn z history-substring-search brew docker)</code></p>\n<p>and make sure you add an alias for mvn so you get the color goodness, I’ve also boosted the memory and set java home.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">alias mvn=&quot;mvn-color&quot;\nexport MAVEN_OPTS=&quot;-Xmx512M&quot;\nexport JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)</code></pre></div>\n<p>Enjoy the ‘pretty’ output</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Adding color to Maven output","date":"February 01, 2017"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2017-02-01-adding-color-to-maven-output/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2017-02-01-mapstruct-and-lombok-working-together/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mapstruct and Lombok working together"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2017-02-02-creating-little-animated-gif-s-of-what-s-happening-on-screen/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Creating little animated GIF's of what's happening on screen"}}}}
