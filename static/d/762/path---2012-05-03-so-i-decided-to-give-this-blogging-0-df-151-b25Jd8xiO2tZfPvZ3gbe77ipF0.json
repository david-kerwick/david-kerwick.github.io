Switched to a simple view and now this should work</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"html\"><pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>pre</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">class</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>prettyprint linenums<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n/**  \n * @author David Kerwick  \n * Created 3 May 2012  \n */  \n\npublic class HelloWorld {  \n\n    public void hi(){  \n        System.out.println(\"Hello Blogger\");  \n    }  \n}\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>pre</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Which it does, happy days all praise the Internet. It looks butt ugly now time to try figure out themes on prettify, another post perhaps</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Blogger Getting Started","date":"May 03, 2012"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2012-05-03-so-i-decided-to-give-this-blogging/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2012-05-03-google-code-prettify-add-theme/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Google Code Prettify - Add a Theme"}}}}
