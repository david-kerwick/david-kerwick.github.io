As time sure does pass between machines and while the setup will evolve and it’s generally easy enough sort the problems or find the missing config as you go there’s nothing wrong with getting a good base.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Chrome and Firefox<br>\nI’ve just never like Safari. Chrome has totally become the primary browser, Firefox is a habit at this point.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dropbox<br>\nPretty simple start. I went Dropbox Pro a good while ago and use it as a default backup and way of syncing between machines. Of the ones I’ve tried it handles having lots and lots of files the best. The main thing is when you sync several git repos for example, it creates lots of little files. Both Google Drive and OneDrive attempted to burn a hole in my machine indexing, reindexing and syncing these. Dropbox is so much better at it so it got my money. Because there’s so much it’s the first install as the initial sync takes an age.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Atom<br>\nSo I can write these notes… basic setup with Markdown Writer <a href=\"../2017-01-09-moving-to-the-atom-editor\">here</a> still serves me well</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Symlink to Dropbox<br>\nAfter Dropbox has done it’s thing I generally set up symlinks rather than deep driving into the layers of Dropbox folders I’ve set up, for example I point the main Documents folder to Dropbox. Best description for a symbolic link on a mac I’ve found is <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/115646/how-can-i-create-a-symbolic-link-in-terminal\">here</a>\nSo what you will need to do is</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">cd</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">sudo</span> <span class=\"token function\">rm</span> -rf Documents/\n<span class=\"token function\">ln</span> -s /Users/David/Dropbox/Documents/ /Users/David/Documents</code></pre></div>\n<p>You need sudo rights to delete a directory link Documents, this seems to also mean you lose the fancy logo in finder.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>\n<p>iTerm2<br>\nIt’s been so long since I used the standard terminal things seemed weird. There may be others but I haven’t had any need to stray beyond iTerm2 get it <a href=\"https://www.iterm2.com/index.html\">here</a> The splitting of the windows/tabs is what I probably use the most. And I like the look of it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Homebrew<br>\nCould be higher on the list for sure as I know you can use it to install applications and the likes, but I mainly use it of install command line tools.\nGet details on the install <a href=\"https://brew.sh/\">here</a> I’ve wrote about it before <a href=\"../2015-09-06-moving-from-macports-to-homebrew\">here</a> when I moved from macports</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>zsh and oh-my-zsh<br>\nIf using the normal terminal instead of iTerm felt weird using it without oh-my-zsh was like having an arm chopped off, navigating around, going back in history felt all wrong… and slow. My previous posts on setting up the zsh shell <a href=\"../2015-09-06-trying-out-the-zsh-shell\">here</a> and installing oh-my-zsh <a href=\"../2015-09-06-pimping-the-zsh-shell\">here</a> cover the basics.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>git<br>\nNot alot to say, who doesn’t use it at this point</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">brew <span class=\"token function\">install</span> <span class=\"token function\">git</span></code></pre></div>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li>Java<br>\nSo being a java developer kind of need this ;) brew casks have got even better since I last used them</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">brew cask <span class=\"token function\">install</span> caskroom/versions/java8</code></pre></div>\n<p>I need java 8 rather than java 9 for the foreseeable :(</p>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li>Maven<br>\nMay as well collect the set</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">brew <span class=\"token function\">install</span></code></pre></div>\n<ol start=\"11\">\n<li>\n<p>Jekyll<br>\nAt some point I’ll need to check this blog locally, so need to install Jekyll and anything needed for it. Think the setup I’ve done before <a href=\"../2017-01-04-moving-to-jekyll-3x\">here</a> is still good. Versions have changed since of course.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sourcetree<br>\nBest visual git client I’ve come across, I haven’t used many mind as I started using this even before Atlassian bought it.
