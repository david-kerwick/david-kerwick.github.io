But chances are someone will want to go with some mad set of colours so you need to be able to set that up.</p>\n<p>So following the <a href=\"https://github.com/angular/material2/blob/master/guides/theming.md\">guide</a> you need to create you own scss file and add the primary, accent, warn and error colours in there.  They say pick from the <a href=\"https://material.io/guidelines/style/color.html#color-color-palette\">palette</a> and recommend picking the 500’s as your main colour.  I’m in the land of designers now and I’m scared :) all I really need to know how to do is how to change and set custom colours then I can let a designer decide on the subtle shades that work best for the sites needs.</p>\n<p>As I’m using Angular CLI it’s already set up to process scss files so I don’t have to worry about that part, so create a file in your the src folder of your site, you can call it whatever but something like <code class=\"language-text\">your-app-theme.scss</code> makes sense.</p>\n<p>Copy the contents from the <a href=\"https://github.com/angular/material2/blob/master/guides/theming.md#defining-a-custom-theme\">Material 2 theming guide</a> that’s subject to change of course they reckon they can make setting a theme easier.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">@import &#39;../node_modules/@angular/material/core/theming/all-theme&#39;;\n@include md-core();\n\n$your-app-primary: md-palette($md-blue, 800, 600, 900);\n$your-app-accent:  md-palette($md-green, 900);\n$your-app-warn:    md-palette($md-red);\n\n$your-app-theme: md-light-theme($your-app-primary, $your-app-accent, $your-app-warn);\n\n@include angular-material-theme($your-app-theme);</code></pre></div>\n<p>Most of the colour dark arts are handled by <code class=\"language-text\">md-palette</code> the first parameter of which is the main color palette from the colour guide above so <code class=\"language-text\">md-blue</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">md-yellow</code>, etc… this will pick the 500 variation from that colour palette.</p>\n<p>You don’t have to pick the 500, you can pass in the code to use as the second parameter e.g</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">$your-app-accent:  md-palette($md-green, 900);</code></p>\n<p>Which pick’s the 900 for the green palette as the accent colour for example.</p>\n<p>You can also specify the lighter and darker hues you want to use.  Not sure yet where they kick in.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">$your-app-primary: md-palette($md-blue, 800, 600, 900);</code></p>\n<p>So pick a blue 800 as the primary, with a lighter shade two steps down (600) and a darker shade one step up (900).</p>\n<p>Seems good and makes sense in my non designer head, can’t mess things up too bad by sticking with the palettes I think.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Material 2 - Customising the theme","date":"January 14, 2017"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2017-01-14-material-2-customising-the-theme/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2017-01-14-material-2-flex-layout-making-a-sticky-footer/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Material 2, Flex-layout.
