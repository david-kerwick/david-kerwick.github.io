This I find is a good starting point but you tend to have to do a bit of cleanup after.</p>\n<p>One of the things is that I use Lombok and the default generation puts all the annotations on the getters.  This makes adding Lombok a bit of a pain as you have to move all the annotations to the field level before removing the getters and setters.</p>\n<p>But all is not lost, of the bugger all you can customise the location of the annotations seem to be it.</p>\n<p>Create an <code class=\"language-text\">orm.xml</code> file in your <code class=\"language-text\">META-INF</code> folder</p>\n<p>Add the following contents</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;entity-mappings xmlns=&quot;http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence/orm&quot;\n                 version=&quot;2.1&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;persistence-unit-metadata&gt;\n        &lt;persistence-unit-defaults&gt;\n            &lt;access&gt;FIELD&lt;/access&gt;\n        &lt;/persistence-unit-defaults&gt;\n    &lt;/persistence-unit-metadata&gt;\n&lt;/entity-mappings&gt;</code></pre></div>\n<p>Pretty self explanatory, changes the access type from PROPERTY (the getters) to FIELD (the declarations) which makes converting to use Lombok easier.</p>\n<p>You will also generally need to change the time/date mappings I find.
