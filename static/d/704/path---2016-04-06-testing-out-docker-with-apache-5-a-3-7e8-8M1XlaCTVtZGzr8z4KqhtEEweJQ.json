Which is fine if you want to ship the image somewhere else I guess but for now we are only interested in testing.</p>\n<p>The thing with the dockerfile is you can’t mount the local file system as dockerfiles must be portable and mounting to a local host wouldn’t be so that makes sense.  The run command lets you do that and in this case there’s no additional setup as the image has apache set up for you.</p>\n<p>Therefore create a folder for this ‘project’ and create a test index.html in that folder\nThen run</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">docker run -p 80:80 --rm --name my-apache-app -v <span class=\"token string\">\"<span class=\"token variable\">$PWD</span>\"</span>:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ httpd</code></pre></div>\n<p>Then go to the ip of your docker-machine in your browser and marvel at your test file.\nYou can find the ip by running</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">docker-machine <span class=\"token function\">ls</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>So because of the test setup mentioned above you can now change your test file, reload your browser and see your changes.  So that’s a nice code / test cycle right there.</p>\n<p>Lets break down the docker run command. There’s alot going on in it</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Command</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>docker</td>\n<td>main docker command</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>run</td>\n<td>tells docker to run a container</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>-p 80:80</td>\n<td>port map the containers port 80 with the machine’s port 80</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>—rm</td>\n<td>remove the container after shutdown</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>—name my-apache-app</td>\n<td>name the container</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>-v “$PWD”:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/</td>\n<td>mount the current path to the htdocs folder on apache</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>httpd</td>\n<td>the image to run (the httpd from the hub in this case)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>So that’s a test apache up and running and it sure does start mighty quick.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Testing out Docker with apache","date":"April 06, 2016"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2016-04-06-testing-out-docker-with-apache/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2016-04-06-getting-started-with-docker/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Getting started with Docker"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2016-04-06-testing-out-docker-with-php/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Testing out Docker with php"}}}}
