So it turns out before using Google Analytics you have to set it up... I thought the Tag Manager might handle the basic setup but I guess not.  So you kind of end up going down the rabbit hole of setting up a lot of different Google services, I'm sure this is just the beginning.

It's very easy to setup though, it's much bigger than I need but a couple of steps will have you set up and then you can play with all the options later

### First sign up

### Then set up for the blog
Don't think too many of the values matter, it's for my blog so that the what I called the site and gave the live url.

### Note the tracking ID
This will give you the tracking ID which I needed for my setup using Tag Manager which is  [here]({% post_url 2015-06-22-add-google-analytics-to-jekyll%})
