The layout section has an option to not display the buttons for Twitter, Facebook and Google Plus but it seems to be ignored in Dynamic Views.<br /><br />It pretty easy to remove them, several blogs cover it i just wanted to note it for myself really as I seem to have lost the custom css a few times already.<br /><br />Go to Template --&gt; Customise --&gt; Advanced --&gt; Add CSS<br />And add the line  <pre class="brush:css"><br />.share-controls {display:none !important;}<br /></pre>
