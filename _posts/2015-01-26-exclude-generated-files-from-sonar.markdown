I use SonarQube to scan my projects and check for issues.  One of the things you don't want is it reporting on issues in files you didn't create.  For example I don't think there's much point in reporting issues in JAXB generated content.  

In Sonar you can exclude these from the scan as follows  

1\. Log in as administrator  

![sonar_login](/assets/img/exclude-generated-files-from-sonar/sonar-login.png)

The default password is admin/admin

![sonar_login2](/assets/img/exclude-generated-files-from-sonar/sonar-login2.png)

2\. Click on settings

![click_settings](/assets/img/exclude-generated-files-from-sonar/click-settings.png)

3\. Go to Exclusions  

![sonar_exclusion](/assets/img/exclude-generated-files-from-sonar/sonar-exclusion.png)

4\. Go to the issues part of exclusions

![sonar_issues](/assets/img/exclude-generated-files-from-sonar/sonar-issues.png)

5\. Add in the regex that identifies the files you want to skip. For the case of JAXB it's

```
.*file was generated by the JavaTM Architecture for XML Binding\(JAXB\).*
```

![sonar_ignore](/assets/img/exclude-generated-files-from-sonar/sonar-ignore.png)

 You can add as many pattern's as you like
