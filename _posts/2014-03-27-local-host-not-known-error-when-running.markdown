If you are running your own scripts or attempting to run some of the scripts on this blog and you encounter the error  

{% highlight bash %} 
Starting createMachine script ....  
Connecting to t3://hostname:7001 with userid weblogic ...  
This Exception occurred at Sun Mar 23 21:44:02 GMT 2014.  
weblogic.utils.NestedError: Local host not known?!  
Problem invoking WLST - Traceback (innermost last):  
  File "/Oracle/Middleware/Oracle_Home/oracle_common/common/bin/create_machine.py", line 7, in ?  
  File "<iostream>", line 19, in connect  
  File "<iostream>", line 520, in raiseWLSTException  
WLSTException: Error occurred while performing connect : Error connecting to the server : Local host not known?!   
Use dumpStack() to view the full stacktrace :  

{% endhighlight %} 

On the line that connects to the AdminServer, while the error is strange the reason is fairly simple. Â The AdminServer isn't running, start it up and you should be back in action again.
