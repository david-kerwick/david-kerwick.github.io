If you have started writing several wlst scripts for various functions you are probably happy to store the username and password in the script directly while doing dev setup actions. Â If you have started writing scripts that run against production to check the health of the servers or something like that you are probably wondering about a better way to store them.  

Well you can use encrypted values all you need to do in generate them  

Start up wlst  

`/Oracle/Middleware/Oracle_Home/oracle_common/common/bin/wlst.sh`

Connect to the admin server using your username and password  

{% highlight python %}
connect('weblogic', 'weblogic1', 't3://myhost.mydomain.ie:7001')
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
Connecting to t3://myhost.mydomain.ie:7001 with userid weblogic ...  
Successfully connected to Admin Server "AdminServer" that belongs to domain "my_domain".  

Warning: An insecure protocol was used to connect to the   
server. To ensure on-the-wire security, the SSL port or   
Admin port should be used instead.  
{% endhighlight %}

Run  

{% highlight python %}
storeUserConfig('/home/weblogic/user_projects/domains/my_domain/adminServerConfig.secure', '/home/weblogic/user_projects/domains/my_domain/adminServerKey.secure')  

Creating the key file can reduce the security of your system if it is not kept in a secured location after it is created. Do you want to create the key file? y or n y  
The username and password that were used for this WebLogic Server connection are stored in /home/weblogic/user_projects/domains/my_domain/adminServerConfig.secure and /home/weblogic/user_projects/domains/my_domain/adminServerKey.secure.  
{% endhighlight %}

Or whatever directory and filename you want, maybe your user directory if you want to restrict it to one user.  

You should now be able to connect using  

{% highlight python %}
connect(userConfigFile='/home/weblogic/user_projects/domains/my_domain/adminServerConfig.secure', userKeyFile='/home/weblogic/user_projects/domains/my_domain/adminServerKey.secure', url='t3://myhost.mydomain.ie:7001')  
{% endhighlight %}

you can do the same for the nodemanager  

{% highlight python %}
nmConnect('weblogic', 'weblogic1', 'myhost.mydomain.ie', '5556', 'my_domain', '/home/weblogic/user_projects/domains/my_domain', 'plain')  
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
storeUserConfig(userConfigFile='/home/weblogic/user_projects/domains/my_domain/nodemanagerConfig.secure', userKeyFile='/home/weblogic/user_projects/domains/my_domain/nodemanagerKey.secure', nm='true')  
{% endhighlight %}
