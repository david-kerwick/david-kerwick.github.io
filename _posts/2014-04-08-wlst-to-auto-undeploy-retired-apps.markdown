So something that annoys me is having to clean up retired applications, I generally discover them because the deploy fails as the retired app is still present.  
Of course I should check beforehand and remove it etc... but I prefer to run the below script first thing in the morning. Â There should be no deployments that need to be rolled back to the retired version as any problems should have been well discovered.  

{% highlight python %} import os  

def check_app_status(appName, serverName):  
 cd('domainRuntime:/AppRuntimeStateRuntime/AppRuntimeStateRuntime')  
 currentState = cmo.getCurrentState(appName, serverName)  
 return currentState  

def undeploy_app(appName):  
 print 'Undeploying ' + appName  
 stopApplication(appName, targets='my-cluster')  
 undeploy(appName, targets='my-cluster')  

#redirect wlst's own output to null, print lines in the script itself  
redirect('/dev/null', 'false')  

connect(userConfigFile='/home/weblogic/user_projects/domains/my_domain/adminServerConfig.secure',  
 userKeyFile='/home/weblogic/user_projects/domains/my_domain/adminServerKey.secure',  
 url='t3://myhost.mydomain.ie:7001')  
cd('AppDeployments')  
appList = ls(returnMap='true')  
for appName in appList:  
 currentAppStatus = check_app_status(appName, 'my-cluster')  
 if currentAppStatus == 'STATE_RETIRED':  
 print 'Found a retired app ' + appName  
 #email that the script has taken an action  
 os.system(  
 'echo "Auto undeploy retired app %s" | /bin/mailx -s "INFO: Auto undeploy retired application" system@mydomain.ie' % appName)  
 undeploy_app(appName)  
 elif currentAppStatus == 'STATE_ACTIVE':  
 print 'App is running ' + appName  
 else:  
 print 'App is not in one of the running state App: ' + appName + ' State: ' + currentAppStatus  
 #Could email a warning here as well if the likes of prepared states are not desired on the likes of production etc...  

disconnect()  
exit()  

{% endhighlight %}
