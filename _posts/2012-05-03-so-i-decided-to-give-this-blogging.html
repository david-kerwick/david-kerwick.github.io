    <script     src="https://google-code-prettify.googlecode.com/svn/loader/run_prettify.js?lang=css&skin=sons-of-obsidian">    </script><h2>    Blogger Getting Started</h2>So I decided to give this blogging thing a go. &nbsp;Mainly so that when I figure out something I'll have a place to find it again and in theory should help me document the process of doing things etc...<br /><br />So I decided to go with blogger, Wordpress is good of course but I have a Google account and sure it seems to offer more&nbsp;customisation... kind of.<br /><br />So first order to business was code highlighting, I reckon I will be posting code so I want it to look pretty and be readable etc... So it turns out there are loads of options for this but two seem to stand out<br /><br /><b>SyntaxHighlighter</b><br /><a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/">http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/</a><br />Which sure seems to have alot of hits on Google<br /><br /><b>Google Code Prettify</b><br /><a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/">http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/</a><br />Used on Google code and stackoverflow it seems<br /><br />So maybe because I'm used to seeing it on stackoverflow I think I'll try the google code prettify and sure it's another Google project so it'll be easy to integrate into Blogger right?<br /><br />So how does random code look in normal mode<br /><pre><code><br />/**<br /> * @author David Kerwick<br /> * Created 3 May 2012<br /> */<br /><br />public class HelloWorld {<br />    <br />    public void hi(){<br />        System.out.println("Hello Blogger");<br />    }<br />}<br /></code></pre>Not bad really, a bit dull though and as soon as the code got longer it would be hard to read.<br />I also had to get the HelloWorld in, it just won't feel right starting without it :)<br /><br />So how to add the highlighting. &nbsp;Like most things I'm way behind the curve so it was easy find other people who had added it.<br /><br /><a href="http://oneqonea.blogspot.com/2012/04/how-do-i-add-syntax-highlighting-to-my.html">Adding SyntaxHighlighter</a><br /><a href="http://www.milesdennis.com/2010/02/adding-googles-code-prettify-in-blogger.html">Adding Google Code Prettify</a><br /><br />So first roadblock, that sure didn't take long, I haven't even finished my first post!<br />The Edit HTML button they both speak of in the Template section is greyed out.<br />Turns out Dynamic Views don't allow the addition of third party scripts or css.<br />Bummer.<br /><br />So you can do get it working<br /><a href="http://www.alexconrad.org/2011/12/highlight-code-with-bloggers-dynamic.html">http://www.alexconrad.org/2011/12/highlight-code-with-bloggers-dynamic.html</a><br /><br />But that's a bit of a hack I think, so Dynamic Views it was nice not to use you, time to switch to something else.  Switched to a simple view and now this should work  <br /><pre class="prettyprint linenums">/**<br /> * @author David Kerwick<br /> * Created 3 May 2012<br /> */<br /><br />public class HelloWorld {<br />    <br />    public void hi(){<br />        System.out.println("Hello Blogger");<br />    }<br />}</pre>Which it does, happy days all praise the Internet.  It looks butt ugly now time to try figure out themes on prettify, another post perhaps
