<h2> Force wrap of long lines in Firefox</h2><div>So having got Google code prettify working on blogger and being quite happy with myself I was testing it on Firefox bit of a habit I guess. &nbsp;So all looked well on Chrome but on Firefox the long lines didn't wrap and extended beyond the prettyprint box and beyond the blogger page and even beyond the page for the compressed css I displayed. &nbsp;This did not sit well with my OCD.</div><div>So I&nbsp;initially&nbsp;thought it was the theme I put on, there's no way the google css is wrong right... well sons-of-obsidian.css was totally innocent.</div><div>And I guess it's a bit&nbsp;harsh&nbsp;to say&nbsp;prettify.css is wrong. &nbsp;As it's the pre tag that's the offender.</div><div>I guess it's a choice Blogger made to not wrap the pre tag even though it sure looks as ugly as sin when it over flows. &nbsp;I would also have thought the prettify css would handle it as it's job is to make code look pretty. &nbsp;When I knew the culprit is was handy to find some <a href="http://www.mitch-solutions.com/blog/16-wrap-text-in-a-tag">punter</a> that solved the problem.</div><div><br /></div><div>So back into the well worn path of Template --&gt; Edit HTML in Blogger I added this to the head section</div><div><br /></div><pre class="prettyprint">&lt;style type='text/css'&gt;<br />   pre {<br />      white-space: pre-wrap; /* css-3 */<br />      white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; /* Mozilla, since 1999 */<br />      white-space: -pre-wrap; /* Opera 4-6 */<br />      white-space: -o-pre-wrap; /* Opera 7 */<br />      word-wrap: break-word; /* Internet Explorer 5.5+ */<br />    }<br />&lt;/style&gt;<br /></pre><div><br /></div><div>Things now look fine in Firefox and I can sleep tonight :)</div>
