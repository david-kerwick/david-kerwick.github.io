If you run a few Weblogic dev server installs like the ones set up with the scripts in other parts of this blog, or just dev servers in general there's a good chance there's old and useless log files you can get rid of. Mainly because they cause clutter and make it harder to find what you are actually looking for.<br /><br />The find command with it's set of magic arguments will be your friend in this case.<br /><br />So lets layer this up<br /><br /><pre class="brush: bash">find /your/log/dir<br /></pre><br />Will return all files and directories in and under your log directory, which is probably too much<br /><br /><pre class="brush: bash">find /your/log/dir -maxdepth 1</pre><br />Will keep the depth to just your log directory<br /><br />We are only interested in files not directories<br /><br /><pre class="brush: bash">find /your/log/dir -maxdepth 1 -type f</pre><br />Will restrict find to just files.<br /><br />Now we don't want all just the older ones<br /><br /><pre class="brush: bash">find/your/log/dir -maxdepth 1 -type f -mtime +7</pre><br />Will list files modified over 7 days ago<br /><br />Then to restrict to you certain log files, for example I have my weblogic access logs set up as&nbsp;${serverName}_access_%yyyy%_%MM%_%dd%_%hhmm%.log<br />So I can find just them using<br /><br /><pre class="brush: bash">find /your/log/dir -maxdepth 1 -type f -mtime +7 -regex  ".*access_[0-9]+_[0-9]+_[0-9]+_[0-9]+\.log"</pre><br />Once you are happy that is is finding the files you want to get rid of it's time to start deleting. &nbsp;It's best to get the find itself right first because if you go directly to the deleting you might end up taking too much.<br /><br /><pre class="brush: bash">find /your/log/dir -maxdepth 1 -type f -mtime +7 -regex ".*access_[0-9]+_[0-9]+_[0-9]+_[0-9]+\.log" -exec rm {} \;</pre><br />-exec runs the command you specify, in this case rm, {} will be replaced with the file find found \; tells exec it's done.<br /><br />Once you are happy with that it's handy enough add them to a cron job, having individual lines means you can have different time frames for the different logs<br /><br /><pre class="brush: bash"># Remove old log files<br /># Remove access logs<br />30 01 * * * find&nbsp;/your/log/dir -maxdepth 1 -type f -mtime +7 -regex ".*access_[0-9]+_[0-9]+_[0-9]+_[0-9]+\.log" -exec rm {} \;<br /># Remove server logs<br />30 01 * * * find /your/log/dir -maxdepth 1 -type f -mtime +7 -regex ".*_[0-9]+_[0-9]+_[0-9]+_[0-9]+\.log" -exec&nbsp;rm {} \;<br /># Remove application logs<br />30 01 * * * find /your/log/dir&nbsp;-maxdepth 1 -type f -mtime +7 -regex ".*.log\.[0-9]+-[0-9]+-[0-9]+" -exec rm {} \;<br /></pre><br />
