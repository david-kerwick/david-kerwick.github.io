On the shortcut front I came across multicursors which seem all cool and stuff but I haven't had a whole lot of use for them.  These are the kind of ones where you tend to forget how to do them and therefore don't use them when you should.

Maybe having typed this out I'll stand a chance of remembering it or at least know an easy place to find it.

- ALT SHIFT LEFT-CLICK (click where you want the cursor)
- DOUBLE PRESS ALT UP/DOWN-ARROW (copies the cursor up or down from currently location)

A close variant of this is to select and find particular text and have the mulitcursor work from the selections.

- CONTROL G (select next, press again too select again)
- SHIFT CONTROL G (unselect current)
- CONTROL COMMAND G (select all)
