I sync files between a desktop and a laptop using dropbox, in particular this blog so I can jot things down as I think of them and pick up where I left off on the other computer when I want to.

This worked well for the other editors I've tried, I guess they had autosave enabled by default or 'save all' as the default.

For Atom it has the functionality but it's not enabled by default, it's easy to set.

- Head to preferences
- Click on packages  
- Search for 'autosave' it should find the autosave package.
- Click on it's settings button
- Check the enabled box and you should be golden from now on.
